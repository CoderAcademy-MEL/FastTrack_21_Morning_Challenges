# Challenge

A palindrome is a word, number or phrase that reads same backwards as forward.  
Implement a method that determines whether a string is an palindrome.
This method should be called `palindrome?`, take a single string as input and return a boolean value (true or false).
Assume that an empty string is an palindrome.
Your method should be able to take a phrase and determine if is a palindrome regardless of punctuation, capitals and spaces e.g. 'Was it a car or a cat I saw?' should return true.
