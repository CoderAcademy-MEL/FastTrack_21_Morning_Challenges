## Positive Dominant

An Array is positive dominant if it contains more unique positive numbers than unique negative numbers. 

Write a method that will take an array as it's argument, and will return true if the array is positive dominant, or false if it is not.

Note, you may receive some other data types in the arrays. These should be ignored.

E.g. positive_dominant([5, 99, -3, -8, 832, -3, -8]), should return true (as there are 3 unique positive numbers, and only 2 unique negative numbers)

E.g. positive_dominant([2, 2, 2, -5, 2, 2, 2, -3]), should return false

E.g. positive_dominant([2, 4, 6, -6, -4, -2]), should return false

E.g. positive_dominant(["String", 34, true]), should return true
