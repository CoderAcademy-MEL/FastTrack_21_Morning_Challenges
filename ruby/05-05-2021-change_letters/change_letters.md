## Challenge
Write a function called letter_changer which will take a letter, a string 
input and letter to change into.

The program should display the input unless, it contains 
the letter specified in the method argument; for example 's'.

If 's' is included change the output so that it will be 'th' instead.

Examples:
input = say hi
output = thay hi

input = mississippi
output = miththiththippi

Hint:
Look up String on Ruby docs to help.

Check your solution by running:
ruby 15_change_letters.rb
