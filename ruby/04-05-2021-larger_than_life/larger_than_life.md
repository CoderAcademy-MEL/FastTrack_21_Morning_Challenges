## Larger Than Life
Create a method that takes an array as it's argument and returns every number that is larger than or equal to every number that follows it.

E.g. larger_than_life([3, 13, 11, 2, 1, 9, 5]), should return [13, 11, 9, 5]

      (As 13 is larger than 11, 2, 1, 9 and 5, whilst 2 is bigger than 1, but is not bigger than 9)

E.g. larger_than_life([-30, 13, -11, 2, 1, 9, 12]), should return [13, 12]

E.g. larger_than_life([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), should return [5]
