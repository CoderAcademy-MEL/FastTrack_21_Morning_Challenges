# Challenge

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram)
Implement a method that determines whether a string (that contains only letters) is an isogram.
This method should be called `isogram?`, take a single string as input and return a boolean value (true or false).
Assume that an empty string is an isogram.
Ignore letter case. e.g. isogram?('moOse') should return false.
