# Cheat Sheet Webpage

A cheat sheet is a short set of notes used for quick reference. As developers, we need to remember many commands to use different tools and languages. Think of how many commands we have seen already to use bash, git, and asdf.

Your challenge this morning is to begin creating a reference for a language or tool of your choice. Some examples might be:

- Git
- Bash / Terminal
- Ruby
- HTML
- CSS / SASS

Feel free to pick another language or tool as well if you have studied it before the course.

Think about what you want to show. Will it be just commands and their definition, or will you show an example of each one in action? Have a quick look at google images for examples of cheat sheets to get some ideas.

When creating your HTML, research [Semantic Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) and try to choose the right element for what you are displaying. Don't worry if there isn't one. You can always fall back to a `div` or `span`.

## P.S.

You don't need to complete the challenges in this folder or even in this git repository. If you want, you can create a new folder in your home directory `cd ~` and complete this challenge there. In the coming weeks, we will show you how to deploy a website, and if you put the effort in, this could be an excellent first project!
