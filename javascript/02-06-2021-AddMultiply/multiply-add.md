# Javascript challenges

Welcome to Javascript challenges

Like ruby we will be using a testing library to run our test. The unit testing library we will be using for javascript is jest.

To run the test you will first need to install the relevant packages.

To do this you will need to run `yarn install` inside the the javascript directory.

To then run the test the command is:

`yarn test multiply-add.test.js`


# Multiply and Add Challenge

Create two seperate functions. Both functions will take two arguments.

One function will add these two numbers together and return the result.

The other function will multiply these two numbers and return the result.

E.g. add(5, 7), should return 12

E.g. add(5, -7), should return -2

E.g. multiply(5, 7), should return 35

E.g. multiply(5, -7), should return -35
