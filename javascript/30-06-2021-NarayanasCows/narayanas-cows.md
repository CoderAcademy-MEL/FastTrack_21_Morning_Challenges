# Narayana's Cows

Narayana has just moved into his new farm and wants to plan for how much space he will need. Narayana currently has a single calf called Bertha, and she will have a calf every year, starting from her fourth year of life. All of Bertha's children will do the same. Narayana wants you to find out how many cows he will have at the end of a given year. Note that these cows are a special breed that won't die from old age, and none of the offspring will be bulls. See if you can find a solution to his problem.

**INPUT**

`years` An integer representing the number of years.

**OUTPUT**

`integer` representing the total number of cows.

```
--------------------------------------
| Years | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 7 | 10 |
| Cows  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 9 | 28 |
--------------------------------------
```

Note that we start counting from year 0, and all cows will live for `n` years.
